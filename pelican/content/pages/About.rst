:summary: History of name and project

When I was young, I had a dream in which I was giving a lecture to a
large group of people, sort of like a TedTalk. I said, "This is why
we're here." I emphasized the word 'here' and raised my hand and created
a world. Many dreams later, I found myself on a world I had created at
a very special time. I looked to the stars and they twinkled on and off
at regular intervals like some sort of machine algorithm. And then, as
I watched, the stars transformed, swirled, changed as the cosmos was
born. The sight was so awesome that I collapsed on the ground and wept,
overwhelmed by the beauty of it.

A grid of starlight, to be transformed in to a beautiful organic expanse
for the worlds of our minds.

That's what I'm trying to make here.

Secondly, there's the notion of a grid of interconnections. My stories
exist in a pandimensional space where everything is real, but not
everything is real the same way in the same universe. There are
universes with more magic and there are universes with less magic.
It's possible to travel between these universes, but these universes
can also exist inside each other through stories.

If I let my stories exist within this software, truly exist in a way
that acknowledges the interconnected pathways between the stories, then
there should be a way for disparate and mostly disconnected stories to
link to and connect with each other.

That wasn't what started this project, though. I'd had thoughts about
tools to support my style of authoring for years and they never really
went that far beyond a vague "I'd like that." But this?

A key idea that started this was gamefication of the author's story
through the author's universe. This is where we go from simply being a
tool to use in reference to works to a game environment where we engage
with the works at a deeper level. And if we're gamefying the writing
process, then it needs to be interesting enough to stream.
